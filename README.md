## Regex Components

### Anchors

These two characters are considered anchors, '^', and '$'. The upper arrow '^' signifies the start as well as the dollar sign; '$' is the end. The two anchors are used to define the position. 

'^' - Starting

'$' - End

### Quantifiers

This allows us to define the number of the same in a pattern.

'*' - Pattern matches zero or more

'+' - Pattern matches one or more

'?' - Pattern matches zero or once

{} - This allows setting different limits when matching

'{n}' - 'n' Represents the exact number of times that a pattern matches 

'{n, }' 'n' Represents the close to the number of times that a pattern matches 

'{n, x }' 'n' Represents the minimum number of pattern matches, and 'x' represents the max.
